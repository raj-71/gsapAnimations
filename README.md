Website Landing Page with GSAP Animation Library

## Description

This project is a website landing page made with the animation tool GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). With smooth and visually appealing animations, the landing page is meant to make the user's experience interesting and interactive.

The GSAP animation library is a strong tool that makes it easy to make animations that work well. It has a lot of different features and functions, such as timeline-based animations, transforms, easing functions, and more. By adding GSAP to my landing page, I have improved the user experience and made my website stand out.

## Features

- Interactive and visually appealing animations
- Smooth transitions and effects
